TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It was developed by the Google Brain team and released in 2015.

TensorFlow is designed to enable efficient numerical computation using data flow graphs. In a data flow graph, nodes represent mathematical operations, while edges represent the data that flows between them. This allows complex mathematical computations to be expressed in a simple, intuitive way, making it easier to develop and train machine learning models.

TensorFlow provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and libraries for building and deploying machine learning models, including:

TensorFlow Core: The central component of the TensorFlow library, providing support for building and training machine learning models using data flow graphs.

Keras: A high-level neural networks API that makes it easy to build and train deep learning models.

TensorFlow Extended (TFX): A platform for building end-to-end machine learning pipelines, from data ingestion to model serving.

TensorFlow.js: A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser or on Node.js.

TensorFlow Lite: A lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile and embedded devices.

Overall, TensorFlow has become a widely used tool in the machine learning community, enabling researchers and developers to build and deploy state-of-the-art machine learning models for a wide range of applications.
