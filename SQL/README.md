SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating data stored in relational databases. It is a standard language used by database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

SQL allows users to perform a variety of tasks such as creating and modifying tables, inserting and updating data, selecting and filtering data, and joining multiple tables.

SQL is used by data analysts, database administrators, software developers, and other professionals who work with databases. It is an important skill for anyone working with data, as it provides a powerful tool for managing and querying large datasets.
