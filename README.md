# Neural network

![1_3fA77_mLNiJTSgZFhYnU0Q](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110838853/226782532-c79583a7-fe4e-4af8-92be-6c19dc261db4.png)

One min to have a general idea about Neural Network, which is a technique that could achieve many different aims, facial recognition, predicting, music composition, etc.

NN contains virtual ‘neurons’ that are arranged in layers that are connected to each other. The neurons pass on the information and thereby perform calculations.

The connections between the neurons also have values associated with them, called weights.

Those weights tell us how much the information from one layer matters for the next layer. The values of neurons and the weights of the connections are essentially the free parameters of the network.

By training the network, we want to find those values of the parameters that minimize a certain function, called the ‘loss function’. It is an optimization problem, we use a method called backpropagation to solve it.

Backpropagation means if the NN gives us a result that is not good enough, we go back and change the weights of neurons and their connections. This is how the network can learn from failure.

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It was developed by the Google Brain team and released in 2015.

TensorFlow is designed to enable efficient numerical computation using data flow graphs. In a data flow graph, nodes represent mathematical operations, while edges represent the data that flows between them. This allows complex mathematical computations to be expressed in a simple, intuitive way, making it easier to develop and train machine learning models.

TensorFlow provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and libraries for building and deploying machine learning models, including:

TensorFlow Core: The central component of the TensorFlow library, providing support for building and training machine learning models using data flow graphs.

Keras: A high-level neural networks API that makes it easy to build and train deep learning models.

TensorFlow Extended (TFX): A platform for building end-to-end machine learning pipelines, from data ingestion to model serving.

TensorFlow.js: A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser or on Node.js.

TensorFlow Lite: A lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile and embedded devices.

Overall, TensorFlow has become a widely used tool in the machine learning community, enabling researchers and developers to build and deploy state-of-the-art machine learning models for a wide range of applications.

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that was developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and released in 2016. It is built on top of the Python programming language and is designed to provide a flexible and easy-to-use platform for building and training machine learning models.

PyTorch uses a dynamic computational graph, which means that the graph is generated on-the-fly during the execution of the program. This provides a high degree of flexibility and allows for efficient implementation of complex models, such as recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks.

PyTorch also provides a range of tools and libraries for building and training machine learning models, including:

TorchScript: A tool for serializing PyTorch models to a format that can be deployed to production environments.

TorchVision: A library of datasets and model architectures for computer vision tasks.

TorchText: A library for natural language processing tasks, such as text classification and language translation.

PyTorch Lightning: A lightweight wrapper for PyTorch that simplifies the process of building and training complex models.

Overall, PyTorch has become a popular tool in the machine learning community due to its flexibility, ease of use, and strong community support. It has been used to build state-of-the-art models in a variety of fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

# Large Language Model(LLM)
Large language models are a type of machine learning model used in natural language processing that are capable of generating human-like text by predicting the probability distribution of words in a given sequence. These models are trained on massive datasets of text, typically using unsupervised learning techniques, and are capable of generating text that is difficult to distinguish from text written by humans.

Large language models can be divided into two main types: autoregressive models and transformer models.

Autoregressive models, such as the GPT series from OpenAI, generate text one word at a time, conditioned on the previous words in the sequence. These models typically use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers to model the conditional probability distribution of each word given the previous words in the sequence.

Transformer models, such as BERT from Google and T5 from Google Brain, are based on the transformer architecture, which was introduced in a paper by Vaswani et al. in 2017. Transformers use a self-attention mechanism to allow each token in the sequence to attend to all other tokens, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies in the text.

Large language models have a wide range of applications, including language translation, chatbots, content generation, and sentiment analysis. However, they have also raised concerns about their potential to be used for misinformation, propaganda, and other malicious purposes.

# Data Analysis and Analytics
Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data in order to extract useful information and insights from it. The goal of data analysis is to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends in the data, and to use this information to make informed decisions.

Data analysis can be divided into several stages:

Data collection: The process of gathering data from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, surveys, or sensors.

Data cleaning: The process of identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing values, outliers, or incorrect data types.

Data transformation: The process of converting the data into a suitable format for analysis, such as aggregating, filtering, or scaling the data.

Data modeling: The process of creating statistical models or machine learning models to identify patterns and relationships in the data, and to make predictions or classifications based on this information.

Data visualization: The process of creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, or maps, to help users understand and interpret the results of the analysis.

Data analysis is used in a wide range of applications, including business intelligence, scientific research, social sciences, healthcare, and finance. It can help organizations make more informed decisions, identify new opportunities, and optimize their operations.

#### Difference Between Data analysis and Data analytics
Data analysis and analytics are both related to the process of extracting insights from data, but there are some differences between the two:

Scope: Data analysis is a broad term that refers to the process of examining and interpreting data to draw conclusions or make decisions. Data analytics is a more specialized subset of data analysis that focuses specifically on the use of statistical and quantitative methods to analyze data.

Purpose: Data analysis can be used for a variety of purposes, such as understanding trends, identifying outliers, or summarizing data. Data analytics is typically used for more advanced purposes, such as predicting outcomes or optimizing processes.

Techniques: Data analysis often involves using basic statistical techniques such as mean, median, and mode, while data analytics uses more advanced techniques such as regression analysis, machine learning algorithms, and optimization techniques.

Tools: Data analysis can be done using basic tools such as Excel or SQL, while data analytics typically requires more specialized tools such as Python, R, or SAS.

Overall, data analysis can be seen as a more general term that includes a wide range of techniques and approaches, while data analytics is a more specialized subset of data analysis that focuses specifically on the use of statistical and quantitative methods.
