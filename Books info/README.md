If you want to learn Python, I recommend starting with the basics of the language such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming. You can find free resources online such as Codecademy, SoloLearn, or the official Python documentation. Once you have a good grasp of the basics, you can move on to more advanced topics such as file handling, modules, regular expressions, and databases.

To learn AI/ML, I recommend starting with mathematics and statistics such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics. These subjects are essential for understanding the underlying concepts of AI/ML algorithms. You can find free resources online such as Khan Academy, Coursera, or edX.

Once you have a good grasp of the mathematical concepts, you can move on to AI/ML algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, neural networks, and deep learning. You can find free resources online such as the book "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka, online courses such as Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera, or the TensorFlow documentation.

To practice coding, I recommend working on small projects such as building a calculator, a weather app, or a simple game. You can also participate in coding challenges such as Kaggle competitions or HackerRank challenges to improve your skills and learn from others.

Regarding the books to learn ML, DL, NLP, Computer Vision, and CNN, here are some popular ones:

"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron
"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville
"Natural Language Processing with Python" by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper
"Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" by Richard Szeliski
"Convolutional Neural Networks" by Janusz Konrad and Prakash Ishwar
It's important to note that these are just some suggestions, and there are many other great resources available. The most important thing is to start with the basics, practice consistently, and continue learning and exploring new topics as you go along.
