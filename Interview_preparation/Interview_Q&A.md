### Hypothesis testing 
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. The process involves formulating two competing hypotheses: the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1). The null hypothesis typically represents the status quo or a default assumption, while the alternative hypothesis represents what the researcher is trying to prove.

The general process of hypothesis testing involves the following steps:

1. Formulate the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).
2. Select an appropriate statistical test based on the type of data and the research question.
3. Collect data and calculate the test statistic.
4. Determine the probability of obtaining the observed results (or more extreme results) if the null hypothesis were true.
5. Make a decision to either reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on the calculated probability.

### P values

P-values, or probability values, play a crucial role in hypothesis testing. A p-value represents the probability of obtaining the observed results, or results more extreme, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it indicates the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.

Key points about p-values:

1. A low p-value (typically less than a predefined threshold, commonly 0.05) suggests that the observed results are unlikely to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true. In such cases, the null hypothesis is often rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

2. A high p-value suggests that the observed results are reasonably likely to occur even if the null hypothesis were true. In such cases, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

3. The choice of significance level (alpha level), which is the threshold for determining statistical significance, is arbitrary and depends on the context of the study and the consequences of making Type I and Type II errors.

4. It's important to note that a p-value alone does not provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis or prove a specific hypothesis. It simply indicates the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.

In summary, hypothesis testing helps researchers draw conclusions about population parameters based on sample data, and p-values provide a quantitative measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.

### To undestand easily

1. **Hypothesis Testing**: You start with a "null hypothesis," which is like saying, "Let's assume the medicine doesn't work." Then, you have an "alternative hypothesis," which says, "No, the medicine does work." You collect data by giving the medicine to some people and seeing if it helps them.

2. **P-values**: Think of p-values as a measure of surprise. If the medicine really doesn't work (like the null hypothesis says), you'd expect to see certain results just by chance. But if you see results that are really unlikely to happen by chance, it's like getting a big surprise. The p-value tells you how surprising your results are if the medicine doesn't work.

- If the p-value is really small (like less than 0.05), it means your results are super surprising if the medicine doesn't work. So, you start thinking, "Hmm, maybe the medicine actually does work!"
  
- If the p-value is not so small, it means your results could happen fairly often even if the medicine doesn't work. So, you're less surprised, and you might think, "Well, maybe the medicine doesn't really do much."

That's it in a nutshell! Hypothesis testing helps you decide between two ideas, and p-values tell you how surprising your results are if one of those ideas is true.
