### Time and Space Complexity for Common Data Structures in Python

![Time Complexity for sorting](https://he-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/c950295.png)

| Data Structure   | Insertion | Deletion | Traversal | Search | Sorting | Accessing | Space Complexity | Best at             | Worst at  |
|------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|------------|
| List             | O(1)      | O(1)     | O(n)      | O(n)   | O(n log n) | O(1)     | O(n)             | Accessing           | Sorting    |
| Tuple            | N/A       | N/A      | O(n)      | O(n)   | N/A     | O(1)      | O(n)             | Accessing           | -          |
| Set              | O(1)      | O(1)     | N/A       | O(1)   | N/A     | N/A       | O(n)             | Search              | Traversal  |
| Dictionary       | O(1)      | O(1)     | N/A       | O(1)   | N/A     | O(1)      | O(n)             | Search              | Traversal  |
| Stack            | O(1)      | O(1)     | O(n)      | O(n)   | N/A     | O(1)      | O(n)             | Insertion, Deletion, Accessing | Traversal  |
| Queue            | O(1)      | O(1)     | O(n)      |

 O(n)   | N/A     | O(1)      | O(n)             | Insertion, Deletion, Accessing | Traversal  |
| Singly Linked List | O(1)    | O(1)     | O(n)      | O(n)   | N/A     | O(n)      | O(n)             | Insertion, Deletion, Traversal | Accessing |
| Doubly Linked List | O(1)    | O(1)     | O(n)      | O(n)   | N/A     | O(n)      | O(n)             | Insertion, Deletion, Traversal | Accessing |
| Dynamic Array    | O(1)*     | O(1)*    | O(n)      | O(n)   | O(n log n) | O(1)     | O(n)             | Accessing           | Insertion, Deletion |

Note:
- 'n' represents the number of elements in the data structure.
- For dynamic arrays, amortized time complexities for insertion and deletion are O(1)*, but in worst-case scenarios, they can be O(n).
- In the "Best at" column, I've mentioned the operation at which the data structure performs most efficiently compared to others. In the "Worst at" column, I've mentioned the operation at which the data structure performs less efficiently compared to others.
