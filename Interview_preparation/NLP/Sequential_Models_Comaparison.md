These models vary in their ability to capture dependencies, handle input/output sequences, and scale with computational resources. Training considerations include architectural choices, regularization techniques, dataset size, and computational resources available. Users should choose models based on their specific requirements, balancing between performance and computational cost. Additionally, fine-tuning pretrained models can often yield good results with less data and compute compared to training from scratch.
