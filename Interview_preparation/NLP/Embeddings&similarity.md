## Vector Similarity
Generated word embeddings need to be compared in order to get semantic similarity between two vectors. There are few statistical methods are being used to find the similarity between two vectors. which are:

- Cosine Similarity
- Word mover’s distance
- Euclidean distance
####  **Cosine similarity**
   It is the most widely used method to compare two vectors. It is a dot product between two vectors. We would find the cosine angle between the two vectors. For degree 0, cosine is 1 and it is less than 1 for any other angle.
 Cosine Similarity-- The cosine similarity is a similarity measure rather than a distance measure: The larger the similarity, the "closer" the word embeddings are to each other.

#### Word mover’s distance
This uses the word embeddings of the words in two texts to measure the minimum distance that the words in one text need to “travel” in semantic space to reach the words in the other text.

#### The Euclidean distance
Euclidean distance between two points is the length of the path connecting them. The Pythagorean theorem gives this distance between two points. If the length of the sentence is increased between two sentences then by the euclidean distance they are different even though they have the same meaning.

In natural language processing (NLP), a word embedding is a representation of a word. The embedding is used in text analysis. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning.

## Word2vec

Word2vec is a technique for natural language processing published in 2013. The word2vec algorithm uses a neural network model to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence.

These various types of word embeddings offer different approaches to representing words in a numerical format, capturing different aspects of their meaning, context, and relationships. The choice of word embedding method depends on the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the data.


Certainly! Here's a brief explanation of each method, along with their advantages, disadvantages, examples, and ways to overcome their limitations. However, please note that providing code for each method within this text-based interface is not feasible. You can find implementation examples and code snippets for each method in various programming languages through online resources and libraries.

## Count-Based Methods:

##### **Advantages:** 
Count-based methods, such as TF-IDF, capture word frequencies and can provide valuable information about the importance of words in a document or corpus. They are computationally efficient and can handle large datasets.
##### Disadvantages: 
These methods do not capture semantic relationships between words. They treat each word as independent, disregarding the context in which it appears.

Count-based methods like TF-IDF are commonly used for text classification, document retrieval, and keyword extraction.


## Prediction-Based Methods:

##### Advantages: 
Prediction-based methods like Word2Vec and GloVe capture semantic relationships between words and represent them as dense vectors. They can capture syntactic and semantic relationships, and handle large vocabularies efficiently.
##### Disadvantages:
These methods may struggle with polysemy (multiple meanings of a word) and out-of-vocabulary words. They treat each word as a single entity, ignoring different meanings.
##### Overcoming Limitations:
To address polysemy, techniques like word sense disambiguation can be applied. Handling out-of-vocabulary words can be improved by incorporating subword information, such as using character-level embeddings or subword units like FastText.
##### Purpose: Prediction-based methods are widely used for tasks like word similarity, document clustering, and language modeling.
Contextual Word Embeddings:

##### Advantages:
Contextual word embeddings like BERT, GPT, and ELMo capture contextual meaning by considering the surrounding context. They understand the context-dependent meaning of words and handle complex linguistic phenomena.
##### Disadvantages:
Contextual embeddings require significant computational resources for training and inference. They can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive.
##### Overcoming Limitations:
To overcome computational limitations, techniques like model compression or using smaller variants like DistilBERT can be employed. Transfer learning and fine-tuning can also be used to leverage pre-trained contextual models on specific downstream tasks.
##### Purpose: 
Contextual word embeddings are well-suited for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering.

## Subword-Level Embeddings:

##### Advantages: 
Subword embeddings like FastText, BPE, and SWR capture morphological information and handle out-of-vocabulary words better than word-level embeddings. They can represent rare or unseen words based on subword units.
##### Disadvantages:
Subword embeddings can increase the dimensionality of the embedding space and require additional computational resources.
##### Overcoming Limitations: 
Techniques like dimensionality reduction or limiting the subword vocabulary can help manage the increased dimensionality. Additionally, using subword embeddings in combination with other word embedding methods can provide a more comprehensive representation.
##### Purpose: 
Subword-level embeddings are beneficial for morphologically rich languages, handling rare or unseen words, and capturing word morphology.

## Conceptual Word Embeddings:

##### Advantages:
