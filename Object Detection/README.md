Object detection is a computer vision technique used to locate and identify objects within an image or video. It involves identifying the presence of objects in an image or video and their corresponding class labels, as well as the precise location of each object within the image or video.

Object detection can be divided into two main stages:

Object Localization: The first stage involves finding the location of objects within the image or video. This is typically done by predicting a set of bounding boxes that enclose each object of interest. Each bounding box consists of four coordinates (x, y, width, height) that define the location and size of the object.

Object Classification: The second stage involves identifying the class label of each object within the bounding box. This is typically done by using a machine learning algorithm that has been trained on a dataset of labeled images or videos.

Object detection has many applications, including self-driving cars, surveillance systems, and robotics. It can also be used for tasks such as counting the number of people in a crowd or detecting anomalies in medical images. Object detection algorithms typically involve complex machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and are computationally intensive. However, recent advancements in hardware and software have made it possible to perform object detection in real-time on standard computing devices.
