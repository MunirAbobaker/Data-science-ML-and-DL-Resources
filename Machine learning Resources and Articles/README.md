## Neural Network Overview

Neural networks (NN) are a fundamental technique in deep learning, capable of achieving various tasks such as facial recognition, prediction, and music composition.

- NN consists of virtual 'neurons' arranged in layers connected to each other, passing information and performing calculations.
- Connections between neurons have associated weights, indicating the importance of information transfer.
- Parameters of the network (neuron values and connection weights) are optimized to minimize a loss function through training, using backpropagation.
- Backpropagation involves adjusting weights based on errors, allowing the network to learn from failures.
