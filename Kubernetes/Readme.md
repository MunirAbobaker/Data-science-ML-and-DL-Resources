### **Understanding Kubernetes Architecture**

#### **1. Nodes**

- **Definition:**
  - A node is a machine, either physical or virtual, where Kubernetes is installed.
  - Nodes are the working machines where containers are launched by Kubernetes.

- **Role in ML Projects:**
  - Nodes host the ML applications and models.
  - Multiple nodes ensure high availability and load distribution.

- **Failure Handling:**
  - If a node fails, the applications running on that node may become inaccessible.
  - To mitigate this, Kubernetes uses multiple nodes to form a cluster, so the application remains accessible from other nodes.

#### **2. Cluster**

- **Definition:**
  - A cluster is a set of nodes grouped together.
  - It ensures that if one node fails, the application can still be accessed from the remaining nodes.

- **Benefits:**
  - **High Availability:** Prevents application downtime due to node failures.
  - **Load Balancing:** Distributes the workload across multiple nodes, enhancing performance and scalability.

#### **3. Control Plane**

- **Definition:**
  - The control plane, previously known as the master node, manages the cluster.
  - It is responsible for orchestrating and managing the state of containers on worker nodes.

- **Components of the Control Plane:**
  - **API Server:** 
    - Acts as the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.
    - Handles API requests from users, management tools, and third-party services.
  - **etcd:**
    - A distributed key-value store that stores all data for the Kubernetes cluster.
    - Maintains the state of the cluster, including information about nodes and applications.
  - **Controllers:**
    - Responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster.
    - Respond to changes in the cluster, such as node failures or application crashes, and take corrective actions.
  - **Scheduler:**
    - Distributes workloads (containers) across nodes.
    - Assigns newly created containers to available nodes based on resource requirements and policies.

#### **4. Worker Nodes**

- **Definition:**
  - Worker nodes are the machines that run the containers as instructed by the control plane.

- **Components on Worker Nodes:**
  - **kubelet:**
    - An agent that runs on each worker node.
    - Ensures that containers are running in a Pod and reports the status back to the control plane.

- **Role in ML Projects:**
  - Execute the ML models and handle tasks such as inference and data processing.
  - Essential for running scalable and distributed ML workloads.

#### **5. Key Kubernetes Operations**

- **Orchestration:**
  - The control plane orchestrates containers by monitoring the cluster's state and making adjustments as needed.
  - For instance, if a node fails, the control plane schedules the workloads from the failed node to other available nodes.

- **Scaling:**
  - Kubernetes can scale applications up or down based on demand.
  - The scheduler and controllers handle the scaling of containers across the cluster.

- **Self-Healing:**
  - Kubernetes automatically replaces failed containers and restarts them to ensure application availability.
