GNN stands for Graph Neural Network, which is a type of machine learning model designed to operate on graphs and other network data structures.

In a graph, nodes are connected by edges that represent relationships or connections between them. GNNs are designed to learn from and operate on these graph structures, allowing them to model complex relationships and dependencies between nodes.

GNNs work by propagating information through the graph structure, updating each node's representation based on its neighboring nodes and edges. This propagation process is typically performed through a series of message-passing steps that update node features based on the features of neighboring nodes and edges.

GNNs have been used in a variety of applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and drug discovery. They have been shown to be particularly effective in tasks where the relationships between data points are crucial for accurate predictions, such as in protein structure prediction and traffic prediction.

Some popular GNN architectures include Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and GraphSAGE.
