Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual data from the world around us, such as images and videos. It involves developing algorithms and techniques that allow computers to analyze, process, and understand digital images and videos in a way that is similar to how humans perceive and interpret visual information.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning algorithm that are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation. CNNs are inspired by the structure of the human visual system and are designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations of visual data.

CNNs are made up of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers use filters to convolve over the input image, detecting features such as edges, textures, and shapes. The pooling layers then reduce the spatial size of the output feature maps, making the network more efficient and allowing it to focus on the most important features. The fully connected layers then take the output from the convolutional and pooling layers and use it to make a final classification or prediction.

CNNs have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of computer vision tasks and are widely used in industry and academia for image and video analysis.
