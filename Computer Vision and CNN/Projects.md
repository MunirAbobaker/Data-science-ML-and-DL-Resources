## Detecting defects in 3D printing Project
As a computer vision engineer, I would explain this project as implementing advanced technology to help 3D printers identify and fix defects. I'd mention that I worked on creating computer programs that can spot problems in 3D-printed items, like cracks or bumps. I'd also say that I improved these programs so they work really well, helping to reduce the number of flawed items and save money in the production process. Finally, I'd highlight that I collaborated with others to make these programs work faster and better, leading to significant improvements in identifying and fixing problems with 3D-printed objects.
