PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that was developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and released in 2016. It is built on top of the Python programming language and is designed to provide a flexible and easy-to-use platform for building and training machine learning models.

PyTorch uses a dynamic computational graph, which means that the graph is generated on-the-fly during the execution of the program. This provides a high degree of flexibility and allows for efficient implementation of complex models, such as recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks.

PyTorch also provides a range of tools and libraries for building and training machine learning models, including:

TorchScript: A tool for serializing PyTorch models to a format that can be deployed to production environments.

TorchVision: A library of datasets and model architectures for computer vision tasks.

TorchText: A library for natural language processing tasks, such as text classification and language translation.

PyTorch Lightning: A lightweight wrapper for PyTorch that simplifies the process of building and training complex models.

Overall, PyTorch has become a popular tool in the machine learning community due to its flexibility, ease of use, and strong community support. It has been used to build state-of-the-art models in a variety of fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
